# C - Data Structures - Singly Linked Lists
## Description
Arrays in C are great for storing multiple identical, in type,
values, and Structs are great for storing different, in type,
date about something. So a combination of an array filled with
structs can be very useful in handling data, however, extending
a dynamic array is very time consuming process because of all of
the transfering that needed to be done to the new extended array.
The solution to this problem is a "Linked List", which is the
concern of this project, particularly "Singly Linked Lists"
## Objectives
* To know when and why using linked lists vs arrays
* To know how to build and use linked lists
