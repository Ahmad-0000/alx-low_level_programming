# C - Functions and Nested Loops
## Description
In this project I will learn a very important concept in
programming as whole not just in **C**.

**Functions** are like loops to reduce **code repetition**, they
are used to apply **DRY** principle and to make the code **reusable**,
thus, learning how to eploit **functions** properly will result in
a more robust, reusable, mantainable code, ... etc.
