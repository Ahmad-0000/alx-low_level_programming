# C - Hash Tables
## Description
**Hash Tables** are one of the very useful data structures in **C**
and in another language , infact, many other data structures
in other languages (e.g **dict** in **Python** ) are built upon the
logic of hash tables.

Hash tables **surpass** arrays and linked lists in the term of
**time complexity**. Searching for an item in a hash table will
nearly always require a **constant time**, that is **O(1)**, but in
collision cases the worst-case-time will be a little bit
longer, but still far better than the worst-case-time in an
array or linked list.

In this project I will implement my own hash table, beside
that I will use the method **"Separate Chaining"** to handle collisions.

> [!Note]
> I will use the algorithm **djb2** to implement the hash function
## Objectives
* To know what is a hash function
* To know what makes a hash function good
* To know what is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
* To know what is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
* To know what are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
* To know what are the most common use cases of hash tables
